📱 My Spot Finder – AndroidApp3

This project is my custom implementation of the GPSLocation tutorial covered in class.
The app retrieves the user’s last known GPS coordinates using the FusedLocationProviderClient API.
🚀 Features

Requests runtime location permissions

Uses FusedLocationProviderClient to get GPS data

Displays latitude and longitude

Handles cases where the emulator does not provide a location

Clean UI with a custom title and button

Fully commented code

🛠 Technologies Used

Kotlin

Android Studio

Google Play Services Location API

View-based XML layout

📌 Notes

The Android emulator sometimes returns null for the last known location.
The app handles this gracefully and displays:
“Unable to get location. Try again.”
(Tested using the Emulator Location tools.)
